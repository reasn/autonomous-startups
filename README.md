# Elegant swarm: autonomous startups

Soon, AI agents will run SaaS startups end-to-end—faster and at a fraction of the cost. I'm assembling the team to make this happen.

## I. Introduction

I've spent my career building startups—as CTO from 0 to series B. After 5 months of focused learning, listening, and thinking made clear: We've reached a threshold where AI can't just support humans building tools, it allows building a system that *build the company itself*.

**Elegant swarm is that system. Agents do the work. People are pulled in when needed.**

---

## II. Context

### A planet of blue oceans
A B2B SaaS that used to cost $100k to build now can launch for <$10k. With cheap ops and AI-native tooling, profitable cases that were once too niche or complex are now easy to build.

➡ Markets will be flooded with new, affordable, useful software.

### Defensibility is disappearing
Tech acceleration is outpacing moats. SaaS defensibility is down, while timing and execution matter more than ever.

➡ Long-term big SaaS bets are increasingly risky.

---

### SaaS startups are becoming a commodity

- Profitable micro-SaaS ideas are everywhere  
- Defensibility is dead—execution speed wins  
- Agentic automation is the new edge

## III. The startup autonomy ladder

1. **AI tools**: Content creation, research, light ops  
2. **Agentic tools**: Multiple agents execute from instructions  
3. **Orchestrator agents**: Manager agents delegate and escalate  
4. **Self-driving startups**: Agents run ops, adjust strategy  
5. **Self-assembling startups**: Agents source, qualify, and build cases

## IV. The venture

### Not a tool. Not a studio.

We're not building a tool or a studio. Elegant swarm is a productized execution system that builds and runs startups with agents in charge—and humans largely out of the loop.

---

### Human-friendly startup compiler

Elegant swarm is a **startup compiler**: you feed in a high-leverage insight—our system does the rest. Strategy, GTM, product—all autonomously generated and executed by agents.

### The team

**[Alexander Thiel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reasn/)**  
CTO 0 → series B | Automation-native | Product, GTM, and AI systems  
Now full-time on Elegant swarm. 

Committed:
- **Staff-level engineer** – 8+ years XP, full-stack, infra, and leadership
- **Senior engineer** – 4+ years, promoted early

Missing: **GTM expert (strategy, execution, and automation)**  
You're ambitious, curious, kind, and unafraid of problems you haven't solved yet.

---

### Sponsor journey
- You've founded a startup before. You spot a strong edge—but you don't have time to pursue it.
- With Elegant swarm, you contribute insight, pay a small fee, and guide lightly. In return, you get a fully agent-run company built on your signal. Strategy, GTM, product—all handled.
- You're looped in, hands-off and earn 10% of the outcome.

---

### Early signals

- Autonomous generation of strategy and product assets live
- Tech proof for autonomous tech and product pipeline, missing: revenue pipeline
- Recursive use: Elegant swarm is building itself
- Enthusiastic feedback from AI founders

## VII. For investors

Elegant swarm builds agent-run SaaS companies—autonomously, recursively, and at scale.

Team: CTO with 9 years in early-stage, engineers committed, GTM co-founder in progress.  
Traction: Autonomous strategy & product workflows live. Used to build Elegant swarm itself.  
This is not a studio. It's a system.
