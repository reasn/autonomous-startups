# Elegant swarm: autonomous startups

---
Soon, AI agents will run SaaS startups end2end—faster and at a fraction of the cost. I'm currently assembling the team to make this happen. If you have strategic and operational GTM experience, write [me@alexthiel.de](mailto:me@alexthiel.de).

# I. Context

### A planet of blue oceans
A small B2B SaaS that used to cost $100k to build now can launch for <$10k. Cheap operations and software fundamentally shift the ratio of lift/labour/cost to revenue potential, i.e. there's an abundance of business cases formerly not worth the effort, which are now easily profitable.  It's not yet clear who will build them, and how.

➡ Markets will be flooded with new, affordable, and useful software.

### Defensibility is disappearing
With the AI acceleration, SaaS businesses increasingly risk their models to be undermined by technological advances.
Deep automation and adjustability of company strategy reduce but don't mitigate those risks

➡ Long-term big SaaS plays are increasingly risky.

### SaaS startups are becoming a commodity
* Defensibility is disappearing
* Available profitable small SaaS cases are abundant
* A startup with higher degree of automation will always be the disruptor.
* The endpoint is autonomous startups.

## The startup autonomy ladder

1. **AI tools**: Basic usage of platforms like ChatGPT for content creation, research, or light ops.
2. **Agentic tools**: Multiple AI “agents” that execute specialized tasks from high-level instructions.
3. **Orchestrator agents**: Managerial agents delegate tasks, monitor progress, and escalate only as needed.
4. **Self-driving startups**: AI agents adapt strategy based on operational and market data, with minimal human input.
5. **Self-assembling startups**: Agents source, qualify, and execute new business ideas fully on their own.

# II. The venture

## Ingredients for autonomous startups, simplified
* ✅ A team edge from repeated strategic and end2end operational ownership of GTM, product, tech, automation, and AI tooling
* ✅ Aligning macro trends
  * Readily available industry best practices for building startups
  * Rapidly improving 3rd-party automation tools for revenue and product operations
* ✅ A platform that self-innovates, cross-pollinates, always uses the best-in-class 3rd-party agentic tools, operated by agentic teams (strategy, revenue, product)
* ✅ An elegant, focused business case (let's talk)


## Approach, tbd & simplified
1. Experienced founders approach us with opportunities based on unique insights into their vertical, but for which they don't have the time.
2. Founders invest 2k€/month, 1-3h/w, referrals, and intros as skin in the game and guidance. They receive 10% of revenue & exit proceeds.
3. Our platform (3 units of agents: strategy, revenue, product) validates, strategizes, and executes.
4. Relentless automation reduces our team's hands-on involvement case-by-case, increasing funnel bandwidth to achieve zero-touch.

## The team
**[Alexander Thiel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reasn/)**, 9 years as a startup CTO, 0 → Series B

I've led and operated early-stage product and tech, often mentoring on GTM strategy.
My heart beats for strategy as much as for code, automation, and communication. Spending winter full-time with AI helped me understand what's coming, the potential of this case, and how well it aligns with my experience and strengths.

Commitments from people who helped me build great things:
* A **Staff engineer**, M.Sc. in CS, 8+ years of end-to-end engineering (infra, back end, front end, product, leadership)  
* A **Youngry engineer**, M.Sc. in CS, 4 years full-stack engineering, just promoted to senior

### Missing: A GTM strategy, execution, and automation expert
You're ambitious, curious, kind, and enjoy the frustrating feeling of not (yet) understanding something.
You've done things equivalent to:
- C-level startup leadership (2+ ventures)
- 3+ end-to-end GTM launches
- 5+ structured business-case analyses
- Day-to-day creator of low/no-code automations
- Deep knowledge of startup/GTM playbooks
