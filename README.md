# Elegant swarm: autonomous startups

---
The current AI revolution changes the rules of software. Here's why I'm convinced that soon, AI agents will run SaaS startups end2end—faster and at a fraction of the cost (*I'm currently building and assembling the team to make this happen*).

# I. Context

### A planet of blue oceans
A small B2B SaaS that used to cost $100k to build now can launch for <$10k. Cheap operations and software fundamentally shift the ratio of lift/labour/cost to revenue potential, i.e. there's an abundance of business cases formerly not worth the effort, which are now easily profitable.  It's not yet clear who will build them, and how.

➡ In the next couple of years, markets will be flooded with new, affordable, and useful software
### Risk and opportunity
With the accelerating speed of AI development, for every SaaS business,
there's a growing risk that its model will be undermined by technological advances.
To stay competitive, organizations must build out two core capabilities in lockstep with the advancement of AI:
* Automation across all departments
* Deep adjustability of company strategy

➡ Building and maintaining these capabilities in a growing human organization is difficult and expensive.

### Preparedness for exponential outcomes is hard
1. Defensibility is becoming hard to predict
2. There's a bounty of available profitable business cases
3. The opportunity costs of getting this race for abstraction/automation wrong, are huge.
4. Autonomous startups are the endpoint of accelerating automation.

🎯 Autonomous startups are the disruptor, not the disrupted.

## The startup autonomy ladder

1. **AI tools**: Basic usage of platforms like ChatGPT for content creation, research, or light ops.
2. **Agentic tools**: Multiple AI “agents” that execute specialized tasks from high-level instructions.
3. **Orchestrator agents**: Managerial agents delegate tasks, monitor progress, and escalate only as needed.
4. **Self-driving startups**: AI agents adapt strategy based on operational and market data, with minimal human input.
5. **Self-assembling startups**: Agents source, qualify, and execute new business ideas fully on their own.

## Ingredients for autonomous startups, simplified
* ✅ A team edge from repeated strategic and end2end operational ownership of GTM, product, tech, automation, and AI tooling
* ✅ Aligning macro trends
  * Readily available industry best practices for building startups
  * Rapidly improving 3rd-party automation tools for revenue and product operations
* ✅ A platform that self-innovates, cross-pollinates, always uses the best-in-class 3rd-party agentic tools, operated by agentic teams (strategy, revenue, product)
* ✅ An elegant, focused business case (let's talk)

# Who's on board
**[Alexander Thiel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reasn/)**, 9 years as a startup CTO, 0 → Series B

I've led and operated early-stage product and tech, often mentoring on GTM strategy.
My heart beats for strategy as much as for code, automation, and communication. Spending winter full-time with AI helped me understand what's coming, the potential of this case, and how well it aligns with my experience and strengths.

Commitments from people who helped me build great things:
* A **Staff engineer**, M.Sc. in CS, 8+ years of end-to-end engineering (infra, back end, front end, product, leadership)  
* A **Youngry engineer**, M.Sc. in CS, 4 years full-stack engineering, just promoted to senior

### Missing: A GTM strategy, execution, and automation expert
You're ambitious, curious, kind, and enjoy the frustrating feeling of not (yet) understanding something.
You bring something resembling these feats:
- C-level startup leadership (2+ ventures)
- 3+ end-to-end GTM launches
- 5+ structured business-case analyses
- Comfort with low/no-code automation
- Deep knowledge of startup/GTM playbooks

## Risks
* Poor execution. 💊: High-performing team + helpful investors
* AI stops accelerating. 💊: We can do with today's level of technology
* Another player, e.g. [iterate.com](https://iterate.com) is too fast. 💊: Let's go!
