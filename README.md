# Elegant swarm: self-driving startups

---
### AI will run SaaS startups end2end—faster and at a fraction of the cost.

- **Most SaaS startups don't get build** because they're too expensive.
- **Agentic AI** executing curated industry best practices can operate existing tools to build and run them cheaply.
- **Infinite pipeline** of potential SaaS ideas: no longer constrained by hiring or overhead.

_**I'm currently building the platform and assembling the team to make this happen.**_

## The startup autonomy ladder

1. **AI tools**: Basic usage of platforms like ChatGPT for content creation, research, or light ops.
2. **Agentic tools**: Multiple AI “agents” that execute specialized tasks from high-level instructions.
3. **Orchestrator agents**: Managerial agents delegate tasks, monitor progress, and escalate only as needed.
4. **Self-driving startups**: AI agents adapt strategy based on operational and market data, with minimal human input.
5. **Self-assembling startups**: Agents source, qualify, and execute new business ideas fully on their own.
